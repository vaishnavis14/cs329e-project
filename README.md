This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease using statistical analysis and machine learning models. The dataset contains 11 clinical variables, such as age, sex, resting blood pressure, and cholesterol, which influence cardiovascular health. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and machine learning algorithms like Random Forest and Logistic Regression, the project identifies key patterns and relationships to build predictive model.
